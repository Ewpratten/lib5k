/**
 * This file part of an effort by Evan Pratten <ewpratten@gmail.com> to build a 
 * system that allows new programmers make use of advanced control theory without 
 * needing to learn the underlying math.
 * 
 * The class(es) below rely on some work that was done by 
 * Matt Morley <matthew.morley.ca@gmail.com> and Tyler Veness <calcmogul@gmail.com> 
 * upstream at WPILib to allow teams to write statespace code in Java via JNI.
 * 
 * The underlying WPILib code is built on top of an advanced robotics software 
 * library from MIT called DRAKE (https://drake.mit.edu)
 * 
 * If you are interested in learning how this code works, I recommend you take a 
 * look at Tyler's paper titled: "Controls Engineering in the FIRST Robotics Competition".
 * The paper is available at: https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf
