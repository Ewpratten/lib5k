# Code Organization

Robot projects should contain the package naming convention that is outlined in [](). Inside this package, we put all Java files that are are viewed as "global". This includes

 - `Main.java`
   - This file is generated by the WPILib setup tool
 - `Robot.java`
   - This file contains the main `RobotProgram` class that is called by the robot's operating system on boot
 - `OI.java`
   - This file contains static functions for reading from driver and operator inputs
 - `RobotConstants.java`
   - This file contains all configuration data for the robot

Also in this package are a few sub-packages:

 - `subsystems`
   - Contains all robot [subsystems]()
 - `commands`
   - Contains [commands]() that read from driver and operator controller inputs, and direct the robot's actions
 - `actions`
   - Contains [commands]() that can be started by the drivers, or by autonomous sequences
   - These commands should do things like
     - Set a shooter's speed
     - Set the height of an elevator
     - Turn to face a computer vision target
 - `autonomous`
   - Contains [`AutonomousSequence`](/lib5k/javadoc/io/github/frc5024/lib5k/autonomous/AutonomousSequence.html) objects that are run during the game's autonomous period
